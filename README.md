Final project:
When you don't want to hear soundcloud ads on your playlists or are too picky in choosing a song
(disclaimer- based on my weird tech house music taste only)


Additional notes:
-responsive layout doesnt work with blotter add on:
  https://github.com/bradley/Blotter/issues/38


Things I would add:
-add in subscribe for weekly playlist based on your mood form in bottom nav 
-function to random generate a song, currently one song per mood
-expand on input keywords and moods, include full sentences

Larger things I would add:
-books, memes, activities near you based on mood
-show options for related songs to continue playing music without entering a new mood
-offer if you like this button- artist performances, similar playlists
